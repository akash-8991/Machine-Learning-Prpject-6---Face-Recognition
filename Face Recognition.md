  # Machine-Learning-Prpject-6---Face-Recognition
  
In this problem, we use a pre-trained model trained on Face recognition to 
recognize similar faces. Here, we are particularly interested in recognizing 
whether two given faces are of the same person or not. 

Dataset can be imported from the tourch library as coded in the python notebook
